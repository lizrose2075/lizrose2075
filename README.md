Hi! I'm Elizabeth, I am a Java developer with 3 years of experience under my belt. 
Currently, I am mostly coding in the Spigot API creating minecraft plugins for people's spigot, CraftBukkit, PaperSpigot and BungeeCord servers!

My other main language is C# and one day I would like to collaborate and create a game using the unity game engine
I also have experience using SQL. 

(By the way for those of you wondering, this is my new GitHub that i will be using from now on)
